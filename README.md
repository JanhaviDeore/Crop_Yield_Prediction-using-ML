# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
**Crop Yield Prediction** is a Machine Learning project that predicts crop yield based on factors like soil, weather, and crop type. It helps farmers and agricultural analysts make **data-driven decisions** to improve productivity. The project uses **Decision Tree Regression** to generate accurate predictions and visualizes key insights through plots and graphs.

## 🚀 Key Features
- 🌱 Predict crop yield using Decision Tree Regression  
- 📊 Visualize data trends and correlations  
- 🤖 Easy-to-run Python scripts for training and prediction  
- 💡 Includes data preprocessing and feature selection  

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn 📈  
- **Machine Learning Model:** Decision Tree Regression 🌳
